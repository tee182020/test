# Loops
## Loop
Loops in python help to execute a given code repeatedly. The loop iterates the block sequentially until the condition is true. The code specified under the loop is indented for grouping.

### for loop
This loop executes a sequence of statements for all the given items in the list or array. The "for loop" break from the loop once the iteration of the values in the list is over.

```python
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```python
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

### While loop
This loop executes the code until the given condition for the execution is true. Here the syntax differs from the C but the logic remains the same.

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
```

**Output:**
```python
0
1
2
3
4
```

### Nested loop
Nested loops are loops inside other loops. However, itâ€™s very inefficient in some cases.

```python
for i in range(1, 3):
  for j in range(3, 6):
    print(i, j)
```

**Output:**
```python
1 3
1 4
1 5
2 3
2 4
2 5
```

## Breaking the loop
- **Break statement** - The loop is terminated by using a break; This caused the pointer to move out of the loop and executes the next statement following the loop code.
- **Continue statement** -  It causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition before reiterating.
- **Goto statement** - Transfers control to the labeled statement.
