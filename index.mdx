# Algorithms

### An algorithm is the set of instructions in steps to solve a problem.

In real-life if you had to count the number of members in a room, you would count one by one until you finish counting the last member.

So we count a member and add one to the previous counted number, go to next member, and repeat the same procedure until there are no members in the room. This is a step-wise procedure and that a normal person follows to count the members.

For a computer to solve a problem or perform a task for us, for example, a counting poblem, we give it a sequence of instructions similar to the step-bt-step procedure humans follow ourselves. An algorithm is a sequence of instructions given to computers to solve problems or perform tasks.

An algorithm can be written by a plain langugae, a pseudo-code or described by a diagram-based flowchart and it can be implemented in different computer programming langugages. 

## Pseudo-code
Pseudo-codes are simplified version of computer programs and written in nantural language.

- Pseudo-code can be read and followed by programmers to write computer programs.
- Pseudo-code does not have specific syntax and can't be executed by a computer.
- Pseudo-code can be implemented in a specific programming language.

for example, a pseudo-code of counting members is as follows:

num_members_far is set to be zero before counting<br />
while the input of member name is not empty<br />
    increment number_members_so_far by one<br />
num_members_so_far is the total number of members at the end

## Flowchart
An algorithm can be described as a pictorial representation with different symbols, shapes, arrow that describes the different process. Each shape describes a different process:

- The process is represented graphically.
- The process is described block by block with the arrows between blocks indicating the order of workflow.
- The described steps are easy to follow.
- Following the logic in diagram does not require understanding of the code.
 
for example, a flowchart of counting members is as follows:<br />
        ---------------------------------<br />
        |    num_members_so_far = 0     |<br />
        ---------------------------------<br />
                      |<br />
                      V<br />
                      *<br />
                    ******<br />
                  **********                      no<br />
     ------->* while input name is not empty *-------------<br />
     |            **********                              |<br />
     |              *******                               |<br />
     |                 *                                  |<br />
     |                 |  yes                             |<br />
     |                 V                                  |<br />
     |    -------------------------------------------     |<br />
     ----|   increment number_members_so_far by one |     |<br />
         --------------------------------------------     |<br />
                                                          |<br />
                                                          |<br />
                                                          V<br />
         ---------------------------------------------------------<br />
         |  output number_members_so_far as total_number_members |<br />
         ---------------------------------------------------------<br />

## Example of Python code implementation
For reference, the above pseudo-code or flowchart can be followed to write a Python code as follows:

number_members_so_far = 0<br />
while (input("name? ") != ""):<br />
     number_members_so_far += 1<br />
print(number_members_so_far)<br />

sample output of the above Python code:<br />
name? Jack Lee<br />
name? Mary Lo<br />
name? <br />
2<br />
