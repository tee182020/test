# Algorithms

### An algorithm is the set of instructions in steps to solve a problem.

In real-life if you had to count the number of members in a room, you would count one by one until you finish counting the last member.

So we count a member and add one to the previous counted number, go to next member, and repeat the same procedure until there are no members in the room. This is a step-wise procedure and that a normal person follows to count the members.

For a computer to solve a problem or perform a task for us, for example, a counting poblem, we give it a sequence of instructions similar to the step-bt-step procedure humans follow ourselves. An algorithm is a sequence of instructions given to computers to solve problems or perform tasks.

An algorithm can be written by a plain langugae, a pseudo-code or described by a diagram-based flowchart and it can be implemented in different computer programming langugages. 

## Pseudo-code
Pseudo-codes are simplified version of computer programs and written in natural or human-readable language.

- Pseudo-code can be read and followed by programmers to write computer programs.
- Pseudo-code does not have specific syntax and can't be executed by a computer.
- Pseudo-code can be implemented in a specific programming language.

for example, a pseudo-code of counting members in a room can be as follows:

```
set total_number_members to zero
loop while the input of member name is not empty
    increment total_number_members by one
output total_number_members
```

## Flowchart
An algorithm can be described as a pictorial representation with different symbols, shapes, arrow that describes the different process. Each shape describes a different process:

- The process is represented graphically.
- The process is described block by block with the arrows between blocks indicating the order of workflow.
- The described steps are easy to follow.
- Following the logic in diagram does not require understanding of the code.
 
for example, a flowchart of counting members is as follows:
```
        ---------------------------------
        |    total_number_members = 0   |
        ---------------------------------
                      |
                      V
                ***************************
               *                           *
              *                             *      no
     ------> * while input name is not empty * ------------
     |        *                             *             |
     |         *                           *              |
     |          ***************************               |
     |                 |  yes                             |
     |                 V                                  |
     |    -------------------------------------------     |
     ----|   increment total_number_members by one  |     |
         --------------------------------------------     |
                                                          |
                                                          |
                                                          V
         ---------------------------------------------------------
         |  output total_number_members                          |
         ---------------------------------------------------------
```

## Python code implementation
The above pseudo-code or flowchart can be followed to write a Python code as follows:
```
total_number_members = 0
while (input("name? ") != ""):
    total_number_members += 1
print(total_number_members)
```

output:
```
name? Jack Lee
name? Mary Lo
name?
2
```
