# File Handling
Python has built-in functions for us to perform operations on files including reading and writing files.

To perform a file operation, first a file has to be opened. Then the file operation is performed. After opertaion is done, the file is closed.

## Opening a file
The built-in open() function is used to open a file. It accessesa file by the specified file name (in current drectory) or a path to that file. 
A mode can also be specified for different operations as follows:
'r': Opens the specified file for reading and this is the default operation.
     An error occurs if a file does not exist.
'a': Open the specified file for appending. A new file will be created if it does not exist
'w': Open the specified file for writing. A new file will be created if it does not exist.
'x': Create the specified file. An error occurs if the file exists.

As another option, the file could be specified to be one of the two types:
't': Text mode and this is the default mode.
'b': Binary mode.

## Reading a file
```
read(): read bytes as a string
readline(): read a line in the file as a string
readlines(): read all lines in the file as a list of string(each line is a string)
```
## Writing a file
```
write(<a string is specified>): write a string as a line into the file
writelines(<a list of strings is specified>): write multiple strings, each string as a line, into a file.
```
## Closing a file
Python function close() will free up the memory spaces used by the file.

### Read in a file and count the number of lines in it
For example, to count how many records in a file named "records.txt" with the content as follows. 
```
1. Jerry Smith, USA
2. Lily Tom, Canada
3. Peter Frank, France
4. Susan Yellen, USA
5. David Elli, Japan
```

It is first opened by open(), then one line is read in and counted at a time, after all lines are read in and counted, the file is closed. 
```Python 
file = open("records.txt", "r")
num_records = 0

for line in file:
    num_records += 1

file.close()
print(num_records)
```
**Output:
```
5
```
## With statement
"With statement" prevents the problem that the file is not closed properly.

### Write some lines to a file by using "with" statement and writelines
```Python
lines = ["Good day!\n", "Hello, how are you?\n", "It is nice to meet you!\n"]
with open("greetings.txt", "w") as f:
    f.writelines(lines)
```
