# File Handling
Python has built-in functions to perform operations on files, including reading and writing files.

To perform a file operation, first,  a file has to be opened. Then the file operation is performed. After the operation is done, the file will be closed.

## Opening a file
The built-in open() function is used to open a file. It accesses a file by the specified filename (in the current directory) or a path to that file. 
A mode can also be specified for different purposes as follows:
```
'r': Opens the specified file for reading, and this is the default operation. An error occurs if a file does not exist.
'a': Open the specified file for appending. A new file will be created if it does not exist.
'w': Open the specified file for writing. A new file will be created if it does not exist.
'x': Create the specified file. An error occurs if the file exists.
```

As another option, the file could be specified to be one of the two types of mode:
```
't': Text mode and this is the default mode.
'b': Binary mode.
```

## Reading a file
```
read(): read bytes as a string
readline(): read a line in the file as a string
readlines(): read all lines in the file as a list of strings (each line is a string)
```
## Writing a file
```
write(<a string is specified>): write a string as a line into the file
writelines(<a list of strings is specified>): write multiple strings, each string as a line, into a file.
```
## Closing a file
Python function close() will free up the memory spaces used by the file.

### Read in a file and count the number of lines in it
For example, count how many records in a file named "records.txt" with the content: 
```
1. Jerry Smith, USA
2. Lily Tom, Canada
3. Peter Frank, France
4. Susan Yellen, USA
5. David Elli, Japan
```

It is first opened by open(), then one line is read in and counted at a time; after all lines are read in and counted, the file is closed and the number of lines is displayed. 
```Python 
records = open("records.txt", "r")
num_records = 0

for record in records:
    num_records += 1
    
records.close()
print(num_records)

```
#### Output:
```
5
```
## With statement
"With" statement prevents the problem that the file is not closed properly.

#### Write shopping items to a file by using "with" statement and write()
```Python
shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "green beans", "turkey"]

with open("shopping_memo.txt", "w") as f:
    for i in range(len(shopping_list)):
        item = shopping_list[i] + "\n"
        f.write(str(i+1) + ": " + item)

with open("shopping_memo.txt", "r") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        print(line.strip()) # strip() removes "\n"

```
#### The content in shopping_memo_txt after execution:
```
1: apples
2: bananas
3: green beans
4: turkey

```

#### Output:
```
1: apples
2: bananas
3: green beans
4: turkey

```
